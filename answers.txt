1. Real World Queues:
    -Restaurant kitchen orders
    -Checkout line at a grocery store
    -Waitlist for an online video game

2. Real World Stacks: 
    -Stack of papers to grade
    -Loading stacked plates on a counter into a dishwasher
    -A one car wide driveway

3. A piece of software passing all it's unit tests may seem like it is working correctly on the surface,
but the reality is that there are ways software can run without running as intended. For example, the
difference between stacks and queues mainly lies in how you remove objects from it: stacks remove from
the most recently added items, but in queues we remove the least recently added items. However, if we
test if objects are being deleted from a stack or queue it would successfully remove them even if
the removal is from the incorrect end, which would not show up on general unit tests. 

4. Linked Lists are better for implementing stacks and queues than fixed-size arrays mainly because 
fixed size arrays mean you need to copy over the array to a new one of a bigger size or vice-versa 
if shrinking, whereas linked lists are dynamic and require way less memory when adding or removing
elements. Arrays also have index searching which makes stacks and queues largely redundant, whereas 
linked lists store more data at once and are easier to use.
